This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
And I used typescript & styled components as well!

## Getting Started

First, install necessary dependencies
```bash
yarn install 
```

Second, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

## While building this website I Realised that if user refreshes the page there has an issue which my Styles do not work) i tried so many times to correc that issue but I can not fix it  
## So please focus on the code and structure !!! thank you))) 

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
